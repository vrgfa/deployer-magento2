Magento 2 Deployer Recipe
===========================

Deployer recipe for Magento 2 project.
This adds some useful tasks for db and media operations and it overrides some 

Install
-------

Install it using Composer:

	$ composer require --dev webgriffe/deployer-magento2 dev-master
	
Usage
-----

Require the recipe in your `deploy.php`:

```php

namespace Deployer;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/webgriffe/deployer-magento2/magento.php';

// ... usual Deployer configuration
```


This recipe overrides some tasks of the original Deployer Magento2 recipe:

* The tasks `deploy:magento` and `deploy` now do not enable and disable the maintenance page. Instead, if you want to do that you must use one of two new tasks `deploy:magento-maintenance` and `deploy-maintenance`.
* The task `magento:deploy:assets` now uses the `assets_locales` environment variable that you can define in your deploy.php file like this:
    ```php
    set('assets_locales', 'en_GB en_US it_IT'); 
    ```
It also adds the `magento:first-deploy` task which is useful when depoying a project for the first time (when Magento is not installed).
